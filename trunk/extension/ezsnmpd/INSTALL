eZ SNMPd extension installation instructions
============================================

1 - install eZ Publish


2 - install and activate the extension as per standard eZ Publish 4 procedures (regenerate autoloads!)


3 - test that the ezSNMPagent.php script is working properly: launch that script from a command line (remember to move first to the eZ Publish base directory)

    php extension/ezsnmpd/bin/php/ezSNMPagent.php -w

    the output should be a list of key/value pairs resembling this:

    1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.1.0 = INTEGER: 1
    1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.2.1.0 = INTEGER: 65
    1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.2.2.0 = INTEGER: 590
    1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.2.3.0 = INTEGER: 65

    To retrieve the value of a single indicator, run

    php extension/ezsnmpd/bin/php/ezSNMPagent.php --get=1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.1.0

    The list of all available indicators and their description is available at:

    http://my.server/index.php/siteaccess/snmp/mib/html

    This is enough if you are going to use the command line script for monitoring.


4 - if you are going to use http (web access) for monitoring, you will have to set up roles and policies.

    The address used to retrieve an indicator value will be similar to this one:

    http://my.server/index.php/siteaccess/snmp/get/1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.1.0

    The output will be a plaintext web page consisting of 3 lines of information.


5 - if you are going to use snmp for monitoring, please continue reading:


5a - make sure you have the net-snmp service installed and properly configured with at least a basic configuration

    a simple way is to run the following command:
    snmpget -v 2c -c public localhost system.sysName.0
    (change the '-c public' param to suit your snmp community string)


5b - alter the snmpd.conf file (usually found in /etc/snmp) and restart the service. Example line to add:

    pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1 /var/www/eZ/extension/ezsnmpd/bin\shell/ezSNMPagent.sh

    or

    pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1 D:\htdocs\eZ\extension\ezsnmpd\bin\win\ezSNMPagent.bat

    (change the path to the ezSNMPagent script according to your eZ Publish installation;
    you might also need to alter the script in itself if php is not in your PATH)


5c - test that the extension works by running

    snmpget -v 2c -c public localhost 1.3.6.1.4.1.33120.1.2.1.1.0

    (change the '-c public' param above to suit your snmp community string)


5d - you can retrieve the eZ Publish MIB to install in monitoring tools by pointing the browser at

    http://my.ezpublish.site/index.php/siteaccess/snmp/mib/ezsystems.mib

    Please note that by default that page is world-readable.

    Another way to retrieve the mib file is to run the cli script:

    php extension/ezsnmpd/bin/php/ezSNMPagent.php -m > ezsystems.mib
