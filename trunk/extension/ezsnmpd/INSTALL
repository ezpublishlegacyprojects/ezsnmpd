eZ SNMPd extension 0.1 installation instructions

- install eZ Publish


- install and activate the extension as per standard eZ Publish 4.0 procedures (regenerate autoloads)


- make sure you have the net-snmp service installed and properly configured with at least a basic configuration


- alter the snmpd.conf (usually found in /etc/snmp) and restart the service. Example line to add:

    pass_persist .1.3.6.1.4.1.35000.1 \var\www\eZ\extension\ezsnmpd\bin\php\ezSNMPagent.php

    or

    pass_persist .1.3.6.1.4.1.35000.1 D:\htdocs\eZ\extension\ezsnmpd\bin\win\ezSNMPagent.bat


- test that the extension works by running

    snmpget -v1 -c public -v 1 localhost 1.3.6.1.4.1.35000.1.2.1.1.1

    (change the '-c public' param above to suit your snmp community string)


- if the above command results in an error message, test that the ezSNMPagent.php script is working properly

    launch that script from a command line (remember to move first to the eZ Publish base directory)
	the script should start and wait for commands, without echoing anything to screen
	type PING [enter]. The script should answer PONG
	type GET [enter] 1.3.6.1.4.1.35000.1.2.1.1.1 [enter]. The script should answer something like this:
	1.3.6.1.4.1.35000.1.2.1.1.1
    integer
    44
    type QUIT [enter]
