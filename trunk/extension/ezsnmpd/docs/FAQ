Q: I installed the extension, now where do I see monitoring reports?
A: This extension does not provide on its own any report or graphical interface
   to show the working condition of your eZ Publish server. It only exposes some
   indicator values that 'can be used' to monitor the status of the server.
   The actual tool used to query the values and store them / display them / provide
   reports or alerts needs to be set up separately. Since the protocol used to
   expose indicator values is an industry standard (snmp), most monitoring tools
   will do, with a little configuration. OSS tools include nagios, zenoss, munin,
   hyperic and many others.

Q: where do i find the list of indicator values that are available?
A: in the so-called MIB file. It uses a notation that is standard in snmp world:
   ASN.1. It is unfortunately very hard to read by humans, but there are a lot
   of tools that will happily parse it and turn it into something user-friendly

Q: so where is this MIB file? I cannot see it in the distribution
A: it is in fact dynamically generated.
   You can find it at http://my.ezpublish.site/index.php/siteaccess/snmp/mib
   and save it as ezpublish.mib

Q: do you provide plugins for any of those monitoring tools to ease the integration
   of ezsnmpd and the creation of nice looking graphs?
A: not yet, but it is planned

Q: will this extension implement monitoring probes for mysql/apache/other?
A: no

Q: why?
A: because of the principle of separation of concerns. Every app knows best how
   to monitor its internals, and should not try to delve too deep into others.
   Besides, you can install packages to enable monitoring via SNMP of most
   commonly used software:

   Apache - mod_apache_snmp (http://mod-apache-snmp.sourceforge.net/)

   Mysql - http://www.webnms.com/mysql_agent/index.html
           http://www.masterzen.fr/2009/04/13/introducing-mysql-snmp/
		   http://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/monitor-features.html

   Postgresql - pgsnmpd (http://pgsnmpd.projects.postgresql.org/)

   Oracle - Oracle Management Agent

Q: can extra indicator values be added from other extensions?
A: it is easily done:
   - ...
