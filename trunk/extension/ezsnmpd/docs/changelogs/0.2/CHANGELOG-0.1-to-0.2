Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 - released 2009-11-26

*Features:
- added to the status MIB the details of files in cache.
  For every cache type, the status (enabled/disabled), file count and total file
  size are reported.
  NB: this currently does not work in cluster configurations
- added to the status MIB the details of files in storage
  For every subdir of storage, the path, file count and total file
  size are reported.
  NB: this currently does not work in cluster configurations
- added to the status MIB the details of shop orders.
  For every shop order status defined, the number of active and archived orders
  is reported
- added a plugin for the PRTG monitoring tool
- added a shell script to ease usage with the net-snmpd agent on unices
- added -w option to the php script, that prints the equivalent of snmpwalk
- add an automatically calculated unique id in a comment in the MIB to allow
  differentiating it when different handlers are activated

*Bugfixes:
- proper sorting of oid arrays (allows snmpwalk for the settings handler)
- improved windows batch file to work when eZPublish is installed on a drive
  other than the system one
- complete mib is printed from cli script (generic part was missing)
- reconnect to db in status mib if 2 get operations are done in the same script
- the mib generated by the SettingsHandler class is now conformant to SMIv2.
  IMPORTANT this means that the names of the oids have changed

*Misc changes
- moved the root-mib file to /sare from /modules/snmp
- IMPORTANT for developers: the api of class eZsnmpdHandler has changed.
  You will need to fix subclasses if any have been created.
  Also the api of eZSNMPd has chanegd.
