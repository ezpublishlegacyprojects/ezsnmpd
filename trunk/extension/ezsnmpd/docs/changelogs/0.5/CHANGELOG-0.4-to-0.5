Changes from 0.4 to 0.5 - released 2010-02-xx

*Features:
- added a new view mode the list of existing oids is shown as an html list instead of the standard MIB: snmp/mib/html
  The underlying code changes also pave the way for easy creation of plugins specific to different monitoring tools

*Bugfixes:

*Misc changes
- the handler functions should now return a tree structure defining the mib they handle, instead of a textual ASN.1 representation
  This allows for both less code to be written and more output formats (eg. html pages with the MIB described or xml format for monitoring tools plugins)
  (directly producing asn.1 in textual form is supported but DEPRECATED)
- the names of oids in the optional 'settings' MIB have been changed to improve smilint compliance
