to do:

+ fix cli script not working if called from an eZP install with symlinks

+ fix support for getnext (snmpwalk is still ko ?)

+ settle on a list of MIBs, gettable and settable
  - finish ini settings mib: add support for array values, writing settings
  - add stats from ggsysinfo to status mib (here or in ggsysinfo ???): cache-files per cache type, files in storage per dir
  - finish counters imported from ezmunin (missing: nbr. of cache-block and view-cache templates)
  - add other info from eZP admin interface: active sessions / logged in users, upgrade_check, etc...

+ improve install / readme doc

+ add plugins with config for std pollers: nagios, cacti, munin, opensnmp, zenoss, hyperic, zabbix, ...

+ facilitate process of creating MIBs at the same time as pollers

+ ...

+ profit!!!


done:
- fix snmpd agent to actually set siteaccess if passed as 1st param
- allow cli script to be called with params to get/set a single oid or retrieve mib (one-shot calls)
- disconnect from db after every status query, to avoid keeping resources occupied
- add a try/catch around db->connect, to be compatible with 4.1
- add an ezp version nr oid
- add an oid per ini setting, per ini block, per ini file
