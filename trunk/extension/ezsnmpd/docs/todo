to do:

+ fix cli script not working if called from an eZP install with symlinks (side-effect of snmp agent not executing script from within ezp root dir)

+ fix support for getnext (snmpwalk is still ko ?)

+ test: disconnect from db after every status query, to avoid keeping resources occupied

+ settle on a list of MIBs, gettable and settable
  - add stats from ggsysinfo to status mib: cache-files per cache type, files in storage per dir
  - finish counters imported from ezmunin (missing: nbr. of cache-block and view-cache templates)
  - add other info from eZP admin interface:
    - active sessions
	- logged in users
	- upgrade_check
  - nodes a and objects (full info, identified by id)
  - pending items (drafts and items waiting for approval)
  - object count per version
  - webshop objects in the different stages
  - a set of common db corruption cases tests
  -  etc...

+ finish ini settings mib: add support for array values, writing settings

+ improve install / readme doc (add section on anon user access to snmp/get via custom siteaccess)

+ add php script (or sh wrapper) for one-shot calls from net-snmp agent, for those who fear a long-running php

+ add plugins with config for std pollers: nagios, cacti, munin, opensnmp, zenoss, hyperic, zabbix, ...

+ facilitate process of creating MIBs at the same time as handlers

+ ...

+ profit!!!


done:
- fix snmpd agent to actually set siteaccess if passed as 1st param
- allow cli script to be called with params to get/set a single oid or retrieve mib (one-shot calls)
- add a try/catch around db->connect, to be compatible with 4.1
- add an ezp version nr. oid
- add an oid per ini setting, per ini block, per ini file
- add an oid with current siteaccess
- improve install / readme doc (add links to snmp modules for mysql and apache)
