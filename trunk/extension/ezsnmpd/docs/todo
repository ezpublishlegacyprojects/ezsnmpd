+ disconnect from db after every status query, to avoid keeping resources occupied

+ add a try/catch around db->connect, to be compatible with 4.1

+ fix cli script not working if called from an eZP install with symlinks

+ fix support for getnext (snmpwalk is still ko)

+ finish counters imported from ezmunin

+ add an ezp version nr oid

+ settle on a list of MIBs, gettable and settable
  - add an oid per ini setting, per ini block, per ini file
    - create a php script to generate a settings mib from standard ini files ot viceversa (mis: type, description)
  - add stats from ggsysinfo to status oid (here or in ggsysinfo ???)

+ improve mib generation. Right now top-level mib nodes are hardcoded in the base MIB...

+ write install doc

+ add plugins with config for std pollers: nagios, cacti, munin, opensnmp, zenoss, hyperic, zabbix, ...

+ ...

+ profit!!!

done:
- fix snmpd agent to actually set siteaccess if passed as 1st param
- allow cli script to be called with params to get/set a single oid (one-shot calls)
