to do:

+ fix string-based-sorting of oids in ezsnmpd class: getnext fails on settings handler because 10.109.4 comes before 10.11 => test

+ add support for tabular values

+ fix usage of pass_persist mode (also allow handlers to know it they can cahe internal data structures or not)

+ fix cli script not working if called from an eZP install with symlinks (side-effect of snmp agent not executing script from within ezp root dir) => test on linux

+ test extensively support for the set command (in 'pass' mode try changing siteaccess via '-a' option)

+ test: disconnect from db after every status query, to avoid keeping resources occupied in pass_persist mode

+ allow support for getnext/snmpwalk when handlers have x.* in their oid list (allow settings handler to work faster by not loading exact list of oids unless queried or fix pass_persist and cache that info)

+ settle on a list of MIBs, gettable and settable
  - add stats from ggsysinfo to status mib: cache-files per cache type, files in storage per dir
  - finish counters imported from ezmunin (missing: nbr. of cache-block and view-cache templates)
  - add other info from eZP admin interface:
    - active sessions count
	- logged in users count
	- upgrade_check (ok/ko)
  - nodes, objects, classes, users (full info, identified by id, in a separate branch/handler)
  - pending items count (drafts and items waiting for approval)
  - object count per version
  - webshop objects in the different stages
  - a set of common db corruption cases tests
  -  etc...

+ finish ini settings mib: add support for array values, writing settings

+ add plugins with config for std pollers: nagios, cacti, munin, opensnmp, zenoss, hyperic, zabbix, ...

+ facilitate process of creating MIBs at the same time as handlers (see settings handler as base)

+ add a fetch function to retrieve and set oid values from within templates

+ ...

+ profit!!!
